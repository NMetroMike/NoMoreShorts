# NoMoreShorts
A script to redirect all YouTube Short videos to their normal video URL

YouTube Shorts are a terrible feature.

The scrolling requires 1 scroll per video so you grossly overshoot when scrolling.
Comments pop up over the video while it is playing.
blah, blah, blah etc.

Basically, Shorts is the worst feature to use on a desktop computer and as such, I have shoddily put together this script so that I can finally stop getting tortured YouTube's terrible design choice.

**How to use:**

Whenever you enter a shorts video, refresh the page and the script will redirect you to the normal YouTube URL.

**How to install:**

Download the "NoMoreShorts" folder.

Navigate to your extensions settings and make sure "Developer Settings" is enabled.

Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the "NoMoreShorts" folder.

Voila.
