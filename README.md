# NoMoreShorts
A script to redirect all YouTube Short videos to their normal video URL
YouTube Shorts are a terrible feature.
The scrolling requires 1 scroll per video so you grossly overshoot when scrolling.
Comments pop up over the video while it is playing.
blah, blah, blah etc.
Basically, Shorts is the worst feature to use on a desktop computer and as such, I have shoddily put together this script so that I can finally stop getting tortured YouTube's terrible design choice.
